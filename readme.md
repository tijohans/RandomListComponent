# Random List Web Component

This is a web component created as part of an exercise in the course Full-Stack Web Development at NTNU Gj√∏vik.

## Functionality

This web component works by having a list of items, where you can press the "remove item" button, and then it removes a random item from the list, and displays it in the list of removed items. The list is defined by the attribute you pass to the element in the HTML.
